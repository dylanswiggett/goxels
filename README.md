Goxels
======

An in-progress sparse voxel octree renderer written in Go, loosely based on the [Gigavoxels paper](http://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2009/CNLE09/).

Dependencies
------------

This implementation uses OpenGL 4.3 features, and requires GLEW 1.9.

My fork of the Go-gl project must also be used.
